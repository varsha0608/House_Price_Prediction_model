# House Price Prediction Model

This project implements a machine learning model for predicting house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, etc.

## Overview

The House Price Prediction Model leverages machine learning techniques to predict the price of houses based on input features. It uses a dataset containing historical housing data with features such as:
- Size (square footage)
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Location (city or neighborhood)
- Age of the house
- Amenities (garage, garden, pool, etc.)

## Features

- **Data Exploration**: Analyze and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.
- **Model Selection**: Experiment with different regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, etc., to find the best-performing model.
- **Model Training**: Train the selected model on the dataset and tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.
- **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict house prices for new data based on input features.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R²).


## Installation

To run the House Price Prediction Model, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
   cd house-price-prediction
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Use the `requirements.txt` file to install required libraries.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the dataset**:
   Download the dataset from Kaggle or use your own dataset.
   Place the dataset file (`house_prices.csv`) inside a `data/` folder in the project directory.

4. **Preprocess the dataset**:
   Run preprocessing scripts (`data_preprocessing.py`) to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.

## Model Selection and Training

1. **Explore Models**:
   Experiment with different regression algorithms to find the best model for predicting house prices.

2. **Train the Model**:
   Train the selected model on the preprocessed dataset.
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

3. **Evaluate Model Performance**:
   Evaluate the model using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R² to assess its accuracy and reliability.

## Prediction

1. **Make Predictions**:
   Use the trained model to predict house prices for new data.
   ```bash
   python predict.py --input features.csv
   ```

   Replace `features.csv` with a CSV file containing the input features for prediction.
